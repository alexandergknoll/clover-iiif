# Summary

The Summary component is used to display a short description of the resource. It is a wrapper around the [IIIF Presentation API 3.0 summary property](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#summary). The summary property is a multi-lingual field that can be used to provide a short description of the resource. It is recommended that the summary be less than 250 characters. The summary property is intended to be displayed to the user when the resource is being selected from a list of search results or resources.
